<h2>About
</h2>
<p>
  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
  recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
  Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
  Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
  Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
  action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h3>Thorin Oakenshield
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
      Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the
      dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated
      when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies
      beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree
      branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
      in death.

    <h3>Fili and Kili
    </h3>
    <p>
      Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were
      also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most
      distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

    <h3>Óin
    </h3>
    <p>
      Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. He usually wore
      a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin
      Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely
      Mountain wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with
      them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing
      the fire for the Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled
      in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

    <h3>Glóin
    </h3>
    <p>
      In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among
      the Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to
      recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug. He was noted for his skills with a
      tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the one told to get a fire started
      whenever the Dwarves made camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies. After
      the battle, he returned to the Lonely Mountain.

    <h3>Balin
    </h3>
    <p>
      Balin was part of the company assembled by Thorin Oakenshield in TA 2941 that journeyed to
      the Lonely Mountain with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf to defeat Smaug, and to retake the
      kingdom of Erebor. He was the second Dwarf to arrive at Bilbo's house, where, like his
      brother Dwalin, he played a viol as big as himself. Following the meeting's conclusion and
      the company's initial departure to the Green Dragon Inn, Balin spotted Bilbo hurrying to
      reach them before they set out.

  <div class="col-md-7">
    <h3>Dwalin
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dwalin was the first Dwarf to arrive, alone, at Bag End when the unexpected party
      planned by Thorin and Gandalf began at Bilbo Baggins' hobbit hole. He was wearing a
      dark-green hood and a golden belt, his tucked into the belt and walked in as if
      expected, which greatly surprised Bilbo. Soon Balin arrived and he and Dwalin sat
      talking while Bilbo kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more
      Dwarves. Later, when Bilbo griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in
      setting out refreshments, Dwalin and Balin were the first (followed by Fíli and
      Kíli) to lend a hand. Later still, when the Dwarves filled Bag End with music,
      Dwalin played on a viol as big as himself. Dwalin lent a green hood and cloak to
      Bilbo when they set out on their journey.
      After Thorin's Company reclaimed the mountain from Smaug, Dwalin fought alongside
      his companions in the Battle of Five Armies. He survived the battle, and later
      received his fourteenth share of Smaug's hoard. He chose to live afterwards in
      Erebor under the rule of Dáin II Ironfoot, Thorin's cousin and now King under the
      Mountain.

    <h3>Ori
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the
      year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin,
      Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain,
      culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other dwarves of Thorin's
      Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies, which he survived.

    <h3>Dori
    </h3>
    <p>
      It fell to Dori to carry Bilbo Baggins in the tunnels of the Misty Mountains
      during the escape from the Goblins, but Dori dropped Bilbo, and the other
      Dwarves and Gandalf blamed him for "losing their burglar." Later, during
      their escape from the Wargs and Orcs, Dori helped Bilbo climb a tree to get
      away from the wargs. Bilbo shortly thereafter saved Dori by grabbing his
      legs as they were rescued by the Great Eagles and taken to their eyrie from
      the Misty Mountains. When Gandalf tells their tale to the skin-changer Beorn
      and brings forward the company, Dori came first, along with Thorin.

    <h3>Nori
    </h3>
    <p>
      In TA 2941, Nori, along with Dori and Ori, became part of Thorin and
      Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in search of
      Smaug's treasure in the Lonely Mountain. After their experience in
      Goblin-town when the company was pursued by Wargs and Orcs and forced to
      climb up into some trees, Nori was the first realize that Bilbo had been
      left on the ground and pointed him out to his brother Dori who rescued
      Bilbo.
      Nori did little to distinguish himself during the Dwarves's adventures in
      the wild, though he shared the same array of experiences as the others of
      the Company: captured in turn by Trolls, Goblins, Spiders, and Elves, they
      eventually reached the distant Lonely Mountain and recovered it for Durin's
      Folk.

  <div class="col-md-7">
    <h3>Bifur
    </h3>
    <p>
      Answering Thorin Oakenshield's Quest of Erebor, he went to the
      meeting at Bag End with his cousins Bofur and Bombur, where he
      played the clarinet. On the quest, he was nearly cooked on a spit by
      trolls and nearly killed by Goblins, Wargs, Stone giants, Great
      Spiders, and the dragon Smaug himself. A valiant and brave warrior,
      Bifur never gave up, and fought in the Battle of Five Armies with
      all his strength, killing numerous enemies. In the fallout of the
      great battle, Dain II Ironfoot gave him his share of the treasure,
      and he retired to live at the Lonely Mountain.

    <h3>Bofur
    </h3>
    <p>
      While answering Thorin Oakenshield's quest to Erebor, Bofur went to
      the meeting at Bag End with his brother Bombur and cousin Bifur. He
      accompanied Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and rest of Thorin's
      Company across Wilderland to the Lonely Mountain in order to reclaim
      the dwarves' treasure from the dragon Smaug. Following the dragon's
      demise, Bofur participated in and survived the Battle of Five
      Armies, receiving his fourteenth share of the treasure as agreed
      upon.

    <h3>Bombur
    </h3>
    <p>
      Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur
      and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line,
      although he was descended from the Dwarves of Moria. His
      birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA
      2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the
      youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after
      Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was
      born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was
      thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the
      journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains
      alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

    <h3>Gandalf
    </h3>
    <p>
      Over the years, Gandalf became concerned about the weak
      state of the North. Smaug the Dragon had destroyed both the
      Kingdom under the Mountain and the town of Dale, and the
      wizard feared that Sauron might use the desolation around
      Erebor to regain the northern passes in the mountains and
      the old lands of Angmar. Gandalf knew that exiled Dwarf King
      of Durin's Folk Thorin Oakenshield planned to battle against
      Smaug, but he knew that it would not be enough. In 2941,
      while staying the night in Bree, Gandalf happened across the
      Dwarf King. Thorin initiated conversation; he had been
      having a strange feeling urging him to seek Gandalf. The
      same was intrigued, for he had thought to seek Thorin as
      well. They found they were taking the same road for a while
      (Thorin passing through the Shire on his way to the Ered
      Luin), and they agreed to travel together. Thorin wanted
      advice, and Gandalf in turn wanted to discuss the Dragon
      Smaug with Thorin.
      Ultimately, Gandalf concocted a plan wherein Thorin could
      destroy Smaug and recover his family fortune, albeit with a
      "burglar" of Gandalf's own choosing.
